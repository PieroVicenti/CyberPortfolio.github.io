        <h1>RECENT CYBER ATTACK</h1>
        <p>A cybercriminal pulled off the heist after compromising a bZx developer’s PC and stealing their personal cryptocurrency
        wallet’s private keys via a phishing attack, bZx revealed on Friday (November 5).
        The attacker then drained the developer’s wallet and obtained keys to the bZx protocol’s Polygon and Binance Smart Chain
        (BSC) deployments.
        The hacker subsequently “drained the BSC and Polygon protocol, then upgraded the contract to allow draining of all
        tokens that the contracts had given unlimited approval”, said bZx in a ‘preliminary post mortem’.
        Blockchain security firm SlowMist has estimated that the crypto-thief made off with more than $55 million.
        In response, bZx tweeted that “roughly 25% of this figure is personal losses from the team wallet that was compromised”.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>IMPACT</h2>
        <p>$55 Million, 25% of this figure is personal losses from the team wallet that was compromised.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE</h2>
        <p>Still unknown</p>
        <br>
        <H2>WHAT ACTIONS HAVE THE VICTIMS TAKEN?</H2>
        <p>Freezing wallets,
        bZx found the hacker’s IP address and tracked stolen funds to a number of wallet addresses after being alerted to
        suspicious activity on a user account on the morning of November 5.
        It subsequently disabled the user interface on Polygon and BSC to prevent further user deposits, and contacted Tether,
        Binance, and USDC, requesting that the cryptocurrency platforms freeze the hacker’s wallets.
        In its latest Twitter update posted Sunday (November 7), bZx said: “Over the weekend, we spoke with the law firm funded
        by the DAO which is assisting with this case and bringing the information collected on the attacker to the FBI…
        Discussions have begun around possible terms of compensation in various channels.”
        bZx has implored the hacker to return the stolen funds, referencing a “potential bounty”.
        A similar gambit apparently paid off in September 2020 when a hacker who siphoned $8 million via a security flaw in
        bZx’s smart contract later agreed to return the stolen funds, bZx co-founder Kyle Kistner claimed at the time.
        bZx also succumbed to a pair of quick-fire ‘flash loan’ attacks in February 2020 that together resulted in total losses
        of $954,000.

        <h2>10 MOST COMMON ATTACKS</h2>
        <ul>
            <span class="span"><li>MALWARE</li></span>
            <p>Malware is so common that there is a large variety of modus operandi. The most common types being:
            <br>
            <span class="span">-Viruses</span> these infect applications attaching themselves to the initialization sequence. The virus replicates itself,
            infecting other code in the computer system. Viruses can also attach themselves to executable code or associate
            themselves with a file by creating a virus file with the same name but with an .exe extension, thus creating a decoy
            which carries the virus.
            <br>
            <span class="span">-Trojans</span> a program hiding inside a useful program with malicious purposes. Unlike viruses, a trojan doesn’t replicate
            itself and it is commonly used to establish a backdoor to be exploited by attackers.
            <br>
            <span class="span">-Worms</span> unlike viruses, they don’t attack the host, being self-contained programs that propagate across networks and
            computers. Worms are often installed through email attachments, sending a copy of themselves to every contact in the
            infected computer email list. They are commonly used to overload an email server and achieve a denial-of-service attack.
            <br>
            <span class="span">-Ransomware</span> a type of malware that denies access to the victim data, threatening to publish or delete it unless a ransom
            is paid. Advanced ransomware uses cryptoviral extortion, encrypting the victim’s data so that it is impossible to
            decrypt without the decryption key.
            <br>
            <span class="span">-Spyware</span> a type of program installed to collect information about users, their systems or browsing habits, sending the
            data to a remote user. The attacker can then use the information for blackmailing purposes or download and install other
            malicious programs from the web</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>PHISHING</li></span>
        <p>Phishing attacks are extremely common and involve sending mass amounts of fraudulent emails to unsuspecting users,
        disguised as coming from a reliable source. The fraudulent emails often have the appearance of being legitimate, but
        link the recipient to a malicious file or script designed to grant attackers access to your device to control it or
        gather recon, install malicious scripts/files, or to extract data such as user information, financial info, and more.</p>
        <p>There are several different types of phishing attacks, including:
        <br>
        <span class="span">-Spear Phishing </span>targeted attacks directed at specific companies and/or individuals.
        <br>
        <span class="span">-Whaling attacks</span> targeting senior executives and stakeholders within an organization.
        <br>
        <span class="span">-Pharming leverages</span> DNS cache poisoning to capture user credentials through a fake login landing page.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</li></span>
        <p>Occurs when an attacker intercepts a two-party transaction, inserting themselves in the middle. From there, cyber
        attackers can steal and manipulate data by interrupting traffic.
        This type of attack usually exploits security vulnerabilities in a network, such as an unsecured public WiFi, to insert
        themselves between a visitor’s device and the network. The problem with this kind of attack is that it is very difficult
        to detect, as the victim thinks the information is going to a legitimate destination. Phishing or malware attacks are
        often leveraged to carry out a MitM attack.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>Denial-of-Service (DOS) Attack</li></span>
        <p>DOS attacks work by flooding systems, servers, and/or networks with traffic to overload resources and bandwidth. This
        result is rendering the system unable to process and fulfill legitimate requests. In addition to denial-of-service (DoS)
        attacks, there are also distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
        <br>
        DoS attacks saturate a system’s resources with the goal of impeding response to service requests. On the other hand, a
        DDoS attack is launched from several infected host machines with the goal of achieving service denial and taking a
        system offline, thus paving the way for another attack to enter the network/environment.
        <br>
        The most common types of DoS and DDoS attacks are the TCP SYN flood attack, teardrop attack, smurf attack, ping-of-death
        attack, and botnets.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>SQL INJECTIONS</li></span>
        <p>This occurs when an attacker inserts malicious code into a server using server query language (SQL) forcing the server
        to deliver protected information. This type of attack usually involves submitting malicious code into an unprotected
        website comment or search box. Secure coding practices such as using prepared statements with parameterized queries is
        an effective way to prevent SQL injections.
        <br>
        When a SQL command uses a parameter instead of inserting the values directly, it can allow the backend to run malicious
        queries. Moreover, the SQL interpreter uses the parameter only as data, without executing it as a code. Learn more about
        how secure coding practices can prevent SQL injection</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>Zero-day Exploit</li></span>
        <p>A Zero-day Exploit refers to exploiting a network vulnerability when it is new and recently announced — before a patch
        is released and/or implemented. Zero-day attackers jump at the disclosed vulnerability in the small window of time where
        no solution/preventative measures exist. Thus, preventing zero-day attacks requires constant monitoring, proactive
        detection, and agile threat management practices.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>Password Attack</li></span>
        <p>Passwords are the most widespread method of authenticating access to a secure information system, making them an
        attractive target for cyber attackers. By accessing a person’s password, an attacker can gain entry to confidential or
        critical data and systems, including the ability to maniuplate and control said data/systems.
        <br>
        Password attackers use a myriad of methods to identify an individual password, including using social engineering,
        gaining access to a password database, testing the network connection to obtain unencrypted passwords, or simply by
        guessing.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>Cross-site Scripting</li></span>
        <p>
        A cross-site scripting attack sends malicious scripts into content from reliable websites. The malicious code joins the
        dynamic content that is sent to the victim’s browser. Usually, this malicious code consists of Javascript code executed
        by the victim’s browser, but can include Flash, HTML and XSS.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>Rootkits</li></span>
        <p>
        Rootkits are installed inside legitimate software, where they can gain remote control and administration-level access
        over a system. The attacker then uses the rootkit to steal passwords, keys, credentials, and retrieve critical data.
        <br>
        Since rootkits hide in legitimate software, once you allow the program to make changes in your OS, the rootkit installs
        itself in the system (host, computer, server, etc.) and remains dormant until the attacker activates it or it’s
        triggered through a persistence mechanism. Rootkits are commonly spread through email attachments and downloads from
        insecure websites.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class="span"><li>Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks</li></span>
        <p>
        While internet connectivity across almost every imaginable device creates convenience and ease for individuals, it also
        presents a growing—almost unlimited—number of access points for attackers to exploit and wreak havoc. The
        interconnectedness of things makes it possible for attackers to breach an entry point and use it as a gate to exploit
        other devices in the network.
        <br>
        IoT attacks are becoming more popular due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and (in general) low priority given to
        embedded security in these devices and their operating systems. In one IoT attack case, a Vegas casino was attacked and
        the hacker gained entry via an internet-connected thermometer inside one of the casino’s fishtanks.

        <h2>WHAT EXACTLY IS BLOCKCHAIN?</h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat
            the system.
            <br>
            A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire
            network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time
            a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The
            decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
            <br>
            Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
            <br>
            This means if one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers
            wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all of the distributed
            versions of the chain.
            <br>
            Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are constantly and continually growing as blocks are being added to the chain,
            which significantly adds to the security of the ledger.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why is there so much hype around blockchain technology?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            There have been many attempts to create digital money in the past, but they have always failed.
            <br>
            The prevailing issue is trust. If someone creates a new currency called the X dollar, how can we trust that they won't
            give themselves a million X dollars, or steal your X dollars for themselves?
            <br>
            Bitcoin was designed to solve this problem by using a specific type of database called a blockchain. Most normal
            databases, such as an SQL database, have someone in charge who can change the entries (e.g. giving themselves a million
            X dollars). Blockchain is different because nobody is in charge; it’s run by the people who use it. What’s more,
            bitcoins can’t be faked, hacked or double spent – so people that own this money can trust that it has some value.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="VPNs">
        <h2>VPNs</h2>
        <p>VPN stands for “virtual private network” — a service that protects your internet connection and privacy online. It
        creates an encrypted tunnel for your data, protects your online identity by hiding your IP address, and allows you to
        use public Wi-Fi hotspots safely.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What does a VPN do?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Typically, when you try to access a website, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) receives the request and redirects you
            to your destination. But when you connect to a VPN, it redirects your internet traffic through a VPN server first,
            before sending it over to your destination. Here’s what happens when you connect to a VPN:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            VPN changes your IP and masks your location.
            <br>
            People working in countries with limited freedom of speech rely on private internet connection for their work.
            Sometimes, their lives might depend on it. Someone who lives under an authoritarian regime should use a VPN to hide
            their IP address and ensure extra security for their sensitive messages.

        <h2>What is Cost-Benefit Analysis in Cyber?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a method used to evaluate a project by comparing its losses and gains — essentially a
        quantified and qualified list of pros and cons. CBA is a useful way to assess business projects because it reduces the
        evaluation complexity to a single price figure. As you can imagine, this makes CBA an invaluable tool when it comes to
        explaining the intricacies and selling the value of a robust cyber security strategy to key stakeholders.
        <br>
        Pro tip: Today’s executives report being more open to new cyber security strategies than ever before. In 2020, 50% of
        executives said that they were willing to consider cyber security as a factor in every business decision (compared to
        only 25% the previous year). Use this as an opportunity to build foundations that will help create a sustainable and
        safe future.
        <br>
        One of the most important things to emphasise in your CBA is the inherent trade-off between paying to prevent a mess
        versus paying to clean up a mess. In 2020, attacks cost governments and businesses a whopping $1 trillion — that’s 1% of
        global GDP. For individual companies, the average cost of a single data breach stood at $3.6 million. While UK insurers
        now offer cover for ransomware demands — relieving some of the financial pressure on businesses — the ‘hidden’ costs of
        an attack can still have a devastating effect on operations and a company’s bottom line. For instance:
        <br>
        In 2020, organisations spent an average of approximately £2.9 million pounds recovering from security incidents, while
        the average lifecycle of a breach (from occurrence to containment) spanned 11 months.
        Nearly 80% of companies experienced downtime due to cyber security incidents.
        Lost business costs (including customer turnover and the effects of reputational damage) accounted for approximately 40%
        of the average total cost of a data breach, reaching an all-time average high of $1.52 million in 2020.
        Of course, investing in preventative cyber security measures also comes at a cost. In 2020, global spending on cyber
        security reached an estimated $123 billion. By 2022, this number is on track to top $133 billion.
        <br>
        With that said, there is no reliable way to measure a ‘typical’ cyber security budget, as spending varies from business
        to business and industry to industry. A Gartner report indicates that the average company spends anywhere from 1% to 13%
        of its IT budget on cyber security. In the often-targeted financial service sector, that figure stands at around 10%.
        Amongst large enterprises, 50% spend at least $1 million on cyber security each year, with another 43% spending at least
        $250,000.
        <br>
        Despite these variations, one thing remains crystal clear: for most businesses, the cost of prevention pales in
        comparison to the cost of a breach.
